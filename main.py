  """
    Compression pipeline for a 8x8 block matrix.
    Functions applies 2-D DCT transformation and then quantizes the frequencies 
    matrix. In the next step the function flattens out the block in zig-zag order
    to accumulate non-zeros together and then apply RLE before encoding the 
    block with Huffman Encoding.
    Returns:
        - DC_frequency: the leftmost frequency in the 8x8 DCT matrix. It's needed for different encoding.
        - compressed_block: the 8x8 matrix returned in compressed format after quantization and huffman encoding
        - huffman_table: the huffman table used to encode the top byte in the binary representation. It's needed to be saved for later decoding.
